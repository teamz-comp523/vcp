Project name: VCP Volumetric Capture Processer App

Project description: VCP produces volumetric 3D models from multiple video and data sources. 
This project will build the public-facing interface to a computer vision volumetric capture project being built by the Reese Innovation Lab.

We are going to present the VCP app created by the Reese Innovation Lab to the public using websites. Our website will allow authorized members 
to modify the data, publish new projects, scenes (within the projects) and captures (within the scenes) and download after the upload process is done.
