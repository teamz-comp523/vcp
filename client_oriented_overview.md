## Client Overview



- What are the major pieces of your overall system? Include your architecture diagram (or perhaps a simplified version of it) and describe it in a way the client can understand.



- Where is each piece deployed?
- How can the client manage everything? (You should give your client admin access over the infrastructure, if you haven’t already.)
- How much does everything cost? Is that subject to change? If so, under what conditions? Remember to include yearly subscriptions (like an Apple Developer membership) as well as monthly costs.
- Where does the code live? Is it open source or closed source? Does the client have a license to do what they want with it?
- How can the client access the live app?
- If the app isn’t generally available, is there a way that the client can share the app with somebody else, so that they can use it?
- Of the “need-to-have” user stories (see [Assignment 2](https://comp523.cs.unc.edu/user-stories/)), which ones are complete, partially complete, or unstarted?
- Did you make any progress on the “nice-to-have” user stories? If so, which ones, and how much progress?
- What do you think the highest priority next steps are?
