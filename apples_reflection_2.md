## Apples Reflection 2

### Impression

Our impression of our clientâ€™s purpose has not changed. We have a clear impression of how our platform will be used and how it can help creative people build 3D models by using our platform.

### Mission
We are more excited about their mission in building the first-ever 3D volumetric processing management platform. Our client has demonstrated to us their mission and vision, as well as the possible usage of our platform. Through these conversations, we are excited about the mission of our platform. The platform can help people generate 3D models by simply uploading video clips. And it does not require any background, or learning specific technology.
