## Apples Reflection 2

### Impression

Our impression of our client’s purpose has not changed. We have a clear impression of how our platform will be used and how it can help creative people build 3D models based on our platform.
### Mission
We are more excited about their mission in building the first-ever 3D volumetric processing management platform. Our client has demonstrated to us their mission and vision, as well as the possible usage of our platform. Through these conversations, we became more excited about the mission of our platform. We can help creative people that are comfortable with technologies and those who are currently using 3D modeling. 

### Our work

We helped the client’s mission by building an interactive platform that allows users to manage files and models online based on AWS. The most important feature would be the infrastructure of the project. We use Docker to containerize our project and implemented methods to automatically deploy the product into AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It builds a solid foundation for the project and allows the project to be easily managed and further improved or scaled.
