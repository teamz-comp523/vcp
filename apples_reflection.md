## Apples Reflection 1
For this project, we are building the public-facing interface to a computer vision volumetric capture project being built by the Reese Innovation Lab. This platform is intended to convert userâ€™s digital resources (including videos, photos, and audios) into digitized three-dimensional objects. Nowadays, there are many talented creative people who are not familiar with computer programming and it takes a lot of effort for them to master an existing tool for 3D modeling. Reese Innovation Lab has already built a tool that can automatically build 3D models based on different video inputs for each single shot. However, it is raw code, which means there exists a barrier for those talented people to use this tool. Therefore, we are aiming to build a web-based platform that is easily accessible and simple to use such that creative people can show their talent without worrying about the complex program. With our project, people from all over the world, using various types of devices (desktop, laptop, phone), can easily upload their videos and get a 3D model ready-to-go.
