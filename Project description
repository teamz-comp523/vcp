Project summary:
This project will build the public-facing interface to a computer vision volumetric capture project being built by the Reese Innovation Lab. 
VCP, standing for Volumetric Capture Processor, is an app created by the Resse Innovation lab that produces volumetric 3D models from multiple 
video and data sources.

Technology applied:
Python/Django hosted on AWS for managing and processing multiple camera data files
HTML, CSS, JavaScript template/views
Code managed in Github

Data Modeling (what our project does):
• Superusers will be able to create, login and manage user accounts and data 
• Users will be able to create and log in to an account.
• Users can have multiple Projects
• Projects can have multiple Scenes
• Scenes have multiple captures (at least 2 but can be more) 
• Users will be able to create a new project with a new scene and upload the captures of that scene. Those captures are then processed in the cloud 
and a 3D model is output for download and displayed in the page.
• Status updates include: Uploading, Processing, Complete
• Once the processing is complete, the file stored on S3 is downloadable.
