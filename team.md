## Team Rules
### Team Behavior
- We will use group chat as our communication tool.
- Team members are expected to reply the message within 24-hour window.
- If there is no response from any one of the team members, others are expected to work on their individual parts first and leave message through group chat and email to keep everyone updated.
- A team member who will miss a meeting should notify other members no later than the day before the meeting.

### Coding Style
Team members who are in charge of the frontend should install [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) extension in VS Code to ensure a consistence code style. 

Team members who are in charge of the backend are expected to follow [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). We will use [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf/) tool to help with the formatting along the way.

### Git Collaboration
We are going to use [the Truck-based development](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) git style. We will have a production branch for deploying our project, a dev branch for merging new features and testing, and several feature branches from dev branch. Pull requests are **required** and code review are **expected**.
