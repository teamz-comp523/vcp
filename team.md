## Team Rules
### Team Behavior
We will use group chat as our communication tool. A team member who will miss a meeting should notify other members no later than the day before the meeting.

### Coding Style
Team members who are in charge of the frontend should install [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) extension in VS Code to ensure a consistence code style. 

### Git Collaboration
We are going to use [the Truck-based development](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) git style. We will have a production branch for deploying our project, a dev branch for merging new features and testing, and several feature branches from dev branch. Pull requests are required and code review are expected.
